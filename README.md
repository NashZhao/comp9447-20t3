## Course Summary
COMP9447 Security Engineering Workshop is an applied course on security engineering. Students will learn cloud and distributed computing techniques using AWS and utilise them to build a product and associated SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) tooling and technologies.

SOAR refers to technologies that enable organizations to collect inputs monitored by the security operations team. For example, alerts from the SIEM system and other security technologies — where incident analysis and triage can be performed by leveraging a combination of human and machine power — help define, prioritize and drive standardized incident response activities. SOAR tools allow an organization to define incident analysis and response procedures in a digital workflow format. [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/security-orchestration-automation-response-soar)

The students will be provided with a reference deployment for an application that will be used to demonstrate their SOAR solution's security capabilities. \

## Teaching Strategies
Due to COVID-19, we have made some adjustments to the delivery of this course as per [university guidelines](https://www.covid-19.unsw.edu.au/information-students). This course is fully equipped to be delivered 100% online, however it's probable that there will be some face to face components (more information soon), restrictions permitting. We will let you know more details as we know them.

This course will involve an indicative per week:
* 1 x 90 minute - hands on seminar with AWS Mentors and UNSW Tutors (recorded)
* an additional estimated 7-8 hours of independent learning, collaborative work within your team

Attendance is not compulsory, however we highly encourage you to attend as you will get the most out of this experience.
If you cannot attend a seminar or would like to organise a F2F meet, please email the admins.

## Communication Channels:
This course will be run almost entirely using Discord, Github. (We won't be using webcms or moodle - so please don't hesitate to ask if you can't find something or something doesn't look right)

Discord: will be the preferred method of communication between students and staff this term. Invites will be sent when you have filled in this form:

Github: will be the preferred method of resource distribution to students. Reading material, references, marking criteria, files, etc. will be uploaded to this repo in respective folders.

this README.md: will contain course announcements, updates and the course outline

## Teaching Rationale and Improvements
This course (COMP9447) is designed to give students an opportunity to apply their knowledge and theory to real world applications of security engineering. Therefore, engaging external expertise is a primary part of this course. Partnering with AWS enables students to get mentorship and support as they work on a practical project and learn skills related to this highly evolving industry.

For the 20T3 iteration of this course, we have made the following student-facing changes:
- Increase in the intake of students (from 20 to 40)
- Increase in the number of teaching staff (from 1 admin, 1 AWS mentor to 4 tutors, 2 admins and 5 AWS mentors)
- The addition of self-paced labs for students to complete
- Fixed product ideas and architecture
	- Introduction to system design
	- Security in system design
- Introduction of SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) topic, covering more breadth than previous automated IR topic.
- (TBD)

## Student Conduct
The Student Code of Conduct ([Information](https://student.unsw.edu.au/conduct) , [Policy](https://student.unsw.edu.au/conduct)) sets out what the University expects from students as members of the UNSW community. As well as the learning, teaching and research environment, the University aims to provide an environment that enables students to achieve their full potential and to provide an experience consistent with the University's values and guiding principles. A condition of enrolment is that students inform themselves of the University's rules and policies affecting them, and conduct themselves accordingly.

In particular, students have the responsibility to observe standards of equity and respect in dealing with every member of the University community. This applies to all activities on UNSW premises and all external activities related to study and research. This includes behaviour in person as well as behaviour on social media, for example Facebook groups set up for the purpose of discussing UNSW courses or course work. Behaviour that is considered in breach of the Student Code Policy as discriminatory, sexually inappropriate, bullying, harassing, invading another's privacy or causing any person to fear for their personal safety is serious misconduct and can lead to severe penalties, including suspension or exclusion from UNSW.

If you have any concerns, you may raise them with your lecturer, or approach the [School Ethics Officer](mailto:ethics-officer@cse.unsw.edu.au) , [Grievance Officer](grievance-officer@cse.unsw.edu.au) , or one of the student representatives.

Plagiarism is [defined as](https://student.unsw.edu.au/plagiarism) using the words or ideas of others and presenting them as your own. UNSW and CSE treat plagiarism as academic misconduct, which means that it carries penalties as severe as being excluded from further study at UNSW. There are several on-line sources to help you understand what plagiarism is and how it is dealt with at UNSW:

[Plagiarism and Academic Integrity](https://student.unsw.edu.au/plagiarism)
[UNSW Plagiarism Procedure](https://www.gs.unsw.edu.au/policy/documents/plagiarismprocedure.pdf)
Make sure that you read and understand these. Ignorance is not accepted as an excuse for plagiarism. In particular, you are also responsible that your assignment files are not accessible by anyone but you by setting the correct permissions in your CSE directory and code repository, if using. Note also that plagiarism includes paying or asking another person to do a piece of work for you and then submitting it as your own work.

UNSW has an ongoing commitment to fostering a culture of learning informed by academic integrity. All UNSW staff and students have a responsibility to adhere to this principle of academic integrity. Plagiarism undermines academic integrity and is not tolerated at UNSW. Plagiarism at UNSW is defined as using the words or ideas of others and passing them off as your own.
